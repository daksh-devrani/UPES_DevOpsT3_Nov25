Securing and testing web Apps
- malicious inputs
- unauthorized access
- insecure configurations
- vulnerabilities in third-party libraries
- attacks like XSS, CSRF, SQL injection

As a DevOps engineer you are responsible for:
1. CI/CD Pipeline - must block vulnerable builds
2. Infrastructure - Must enforce security headers
3. Monitoring - detect attacks
4. Automation - run SAST/DAST SCA tools
5. Deployment - configure WAF, security groups, IAM roles, load balancers


XSS - Cross Site Scripting
- It occurs when an attacker inject malicious JavaScript code into a web application

How DevOps can help prevent XSS:
1. Add CSP (Content security policy) headers
2. Template escaping
3. Disable inline JavaScript

Nginx config
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'


CSP - Content Security Policy
- CSP tells your browser where scripts, images, styles, fonts are allowed to be loaded from

add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; img-src  https:; styles-src 'self'";


Block inline scripts
Limit 3rd party script injection
Prevent XSS


CSRF - Cross Site Request Forgery
- Attackers tricks a user's browser into performing unwanted actions

browser automatically sends victim cookies along with the forged request

As a DevOps:
1. Use anti-CSRF tokens
2. SameSite cookies
3. Only PUT/POST for critical operations


Clickjacking Protection
Attackers loads your site in an iframe and tricks users into clicking on invisible elements.

IFrame Protection
Prevent your site from being embedded in iframes on other domains to protect against clickjacking.


Methods for authentication
1. HTTP Basic Auth
2. Token-Based Auth (JWT, OAuth)
3. Multi-Factor Auth (MFA)

Session & Cookie Security

Identity Providers
1. Okta
2. Google OAuth
3. Azure AD

Being a DevoPS:
- Configure SSO
- Integrate OAuth or SAML with your web application to enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for users.
- Apply role mapping
